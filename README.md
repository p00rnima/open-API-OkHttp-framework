## Usage

Currently, the automated tests can be run against test or swapi environments based on settings in the PropertyHelper class.

```
public static String getEnv() { return sysArg("env", "swapi");}
```

You will find your recent test results at the top of the executions list

 ```gradle clean testAPI -Denv=swapi -Dcucumber.options="--tags @swapi"```

## CI / CD

The build pipeline for this repository will compile for every commit to master and keep it ready to run test or sandbox environments 

When run, all API tests will run against the selected environment
